# With Thanks
This project wouldn't have been embarked upon without the following people. 

💡 RADA and my teaching partner Matt Leventhall.

💡 My supervisors [Dr Katherine Graham](https://www.york.ac.uk/arts-creative-technologies/people/katherine/) and [Dr Rebecca Benzie](https://www.york.ac.uk/arts-creative-technologies/people/rebecca-benzie/) for their enthusiasm from the outset.

💡 Ella, Angie and Mum, for their love and listening to me prattle on.

💡 Dad – for your belief in me. Always missed.
