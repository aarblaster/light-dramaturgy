I am an Australian artist and academic. I grew up, lived, worked and have had holidays in the place now called Australia.
I am from Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, land that was never ceded, but was taken.
I have benefited from the theft of this land by my ancestors and the culture I am a product of.

I acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of that land, the Ngunnawal people, as well as the Ngambri, Ngarigu and others who traded on, travelled through and connected with it, and continue to do so. I recognise all Custodians of Country throughout all lands, waters and territories of the place now called Australia.
I pay my respects to the Elders past, present and emerging.
