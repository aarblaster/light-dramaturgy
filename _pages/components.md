This site makes use of the following open source components. 

## Plyr
[Plyr](https://plyr.io) is a simple, accessible and customisable media player.
It's used to embed media player's on the site, to make listening to audio easy for visitors.

Plyr is available on [GitHub sampotts/plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr).
It is developed by [@sampotts](https://github.com/sampotts) with help from contributors.

Plyr is licensed using the MIT license.

## Jekyll
Allows you to turn plain text into static webpages. It powers the free hosting with GitHub. 
You can read all about Jekyll at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com) and find out how to host your site for free.

## Academic Pages, a fork of Minimal Mistakes
[Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) is a fork of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/). Both of these are Jekyll themes that can be used to easily style a Jekyll site. Academic Pages was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme, which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md). It is currently being maintained by [Robert Zupko](https://github.com/rjzupkoii).

I use Academic pages on this site, as it's nice and responsive and is structured in a way that seemed useful.
