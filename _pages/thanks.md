This research wouldn't have been possible without the following people. 
- My supervisors, Dr Katherine Graham and Dr Rebecca Benzie;
- The [University of York](https://york.ac.uk) and the School of Arts and Creative Technologies;
- The staff and students of the [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art](https://rada.ac.uk);
- My colleague and friend [Matt Leventhall](https://mllx.co.uk);
- RADA Principal Niamh Dowling, who's conversations led to me investigating a PhD;
- The Lighting Designers who gave me their valuable time;
- The community of open source developers and researchers, who gave me tools;
- The research participants, Directors, Designers, Electricians, Programmers, Carpenters, Stage Managers, Scenic Artists, Fly Operators, Metal Work Specialists, Costume Makers, WHAM Artists (Wigs, Hair and Makeup), Sound Engineers, Technical and Production Managers, and Prop Makers; who make collaboration possible. 


And always to Ella, Mum and Angie. With all my love.


In memory of Michael, who would have loved that I tried.
