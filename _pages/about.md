Hi, my name is Anthony. I'm a lighting designer for live performance based in London. 
I am originally from [Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, Australia](/aoc). This site is the home of my PhD at the University of York. 
The PhD is focused on developing a dramaturgical toolkit for lighting designers. Tools that can be used within their own designs and inside the broader production.

The research will involve interviews with other practicing Lighting Designers, to capture the detail of their processes. Finding out what has worked, but also, crucially, what hasn't. The research will also pull in research from the existing research into dramaturgy by directors, actors and designers. Research that will inform my practice and the work I do inside production processes.

The research is being conducted at the University of York, but is also supported by the [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA)](https://rada.ac.uk). RADA is providing access to production processes, and support for my research.


## About Anthony
I started this PhD in 2025, while continuing teaching at [RADA](https://rada.ac.uk) in London.
As Deputy Head of Lighting, and Course Leader for the MA Performance Lighting Design, I am jointly responsible for all teaching and learning about lighting in the Academy. Both within Technical Theatre Arts (TTA) programmes, and across the Academy's courses.
I teach lighting design, production electrics and programming on the Academy's practice-based courses. 

I live and work in London as an educator and Lighting Designer. You can find out more about me and my Lighting Design work, at [anthonyarblaster.com.](https://anthonyarblaster.com)

## About This Site
This webpage will be the repository for shared documents, tools and information arrising out of the PHD. 
The exact shape of this site will come into focus as I move through the early stages of the PhD.
I hope it will be a home for recordings, writing, interview transcripts and more.
