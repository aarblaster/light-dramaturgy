This is a post to see if I can work out how the frontmatter renders in this theme.
I have included the following frontmatter

```
layout: single
title:  "Test Post"
header:
 image: "Unbecomming-0006-banner@0.5x-2.jpg"
date: 2025-08-29 10:00:00 +0000
categories: 
  - website
tags:
  - software
```

The items I am trying are specifying the date and time, including a header.
I'll try a teaser as well just for the sake of experimenting.

I also tried changing the date. I've changed the date back to `2025-08-29` and tried a different arrangement of `image`.
Letâ€™s see if that works at all.
