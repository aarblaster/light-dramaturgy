This is the first blog post on this site as a proof of concept. 
As the site gets more complex I am expecting that these posts will become a way of sharing materials from my PhD.
I am also hoping that this will offer me a way of reflecting on the process of doing the PhD.

## Where I am up to
So far I have been researching the methodology I will use for the PhD, that's proving really interesting. 
It's providing me with a framework for thinking about the research. The PhD is focused on the process of creating a lighting design.
I'm therefore more interested than I expected in the **process** of doing the PhD.

I have also been starting the ethics process. Both researching and writing about the ethical components of the research.
That is the main focus for my next meeting with my supervisors.
