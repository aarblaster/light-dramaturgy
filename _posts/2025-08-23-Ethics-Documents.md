I have successfully received ethics approval for my PhD. 
To ensure participants can access the Participant Information Sheets easily and for posterity, I thought it would be a good idea to have them available on this site.

The following files are available:
- [Interview Participant Information Sheet](/files/2025-08-18_Participant_Project_Information_Sheet_-Non-Anonymous-_Staff_And_Pgr_Act_June2024_Arblaster.pdf)
- [Practice-Based Research Participant Information Sheet](/files/2025-08-18_Participant_Project_Information_Sheet_Staff_And_Pgr_Act_June2024_Arblaster_Pbr.pdf)
- [Information Sheet for Participants Covered by a Release Form](/files/2025-08-18_Information_For_Participants_Covered_By_A_Release_Form_Arblaster.pdf)

If you are participating, you can also receive a copy from the researcher by emailing me at [czw527@york.ac.uk](mailto:czw527@york.ac.uk). 
I will also be happy to answer any questions you have about the research and your participation.
You can also use any of the contact information on the information sheets.

This PhD is being supervised by [Dr Katherine Graham](https://www.york.ac.uk/arts-creative-technologies/people/katherine/) and [Dr Rebecca Benzie](https://www.york.ac.uk/arts-creative-technologies/people/rebecca-benzie/), both at the School of Arts and Creative Technologies (ACT). 

This project is being conducted according to restrictions that have been subject to approval by the School of Arts and Creative Technologies Ethics committee. The Chair of the ACT Ethics committee can be contacted on [ACT-ethics@york.ac.uk](mailto:act-ethics@york.ac.uk).
