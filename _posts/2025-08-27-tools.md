There are a number of tools I am using in my PhD, on the off chance sharing them is useful to future researchers.
I have split up the different tools into the kinds of research activity I am using them for. 
Generally, I like to use open source tools wherever possible. Avoiding having files locked into a propriatry format is important for ensuring that future practitioners and researchers are able to access materials. 

## Tools for Writing
I'm thinking her of writing in the broadest sence. Note taking, referencing and more.

### Zotero
[Zotero](https://zotero.org) is a free, opensource citation manager. I have found it extremely useful, particularly because of the ease of finding excellent plugins to help solve problems. 
These make sure that if you have a problem, or a use case that isn't in the core software, someone has probably found a solution.

I am using the following plugins at the moment:
- [Actions and Tags for Zotero](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-actions-tags#readme) to easily apply tags like `/toread` when I add a new resource, or to bulk edit so that all the `Version: First` can be turned into `1`.
- [BetterBibTeX](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex) to allow easy integration with Obsidian.
- [DOI Manager](https://github.com/bwiernik/zotero-shortdoi) to make formatting DOIs easy.

These all make a massive difference (particularly Actions and Tags for Zotero) to my Zotero work flows. Actions and Tags has particularly helped me keep track of the things that I still need to read. Combined with Zotero's colour options for tags, my ability to keep track of resources has massively improved.

### Obsidian
I have been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for all my note taking. Lots has been written about Obsidian for note taking, and it's power. I have been finding that the extensible nature, combined with easy linking helps me to keep track of ideas and notes. Mostly I was looking for a solution to the 'where did I write that' problem.
Obsidian plugins are really useful, and similarly to Zotero the extensible nature of the app helps to solve lots of problems.
The plugins I'm using at the moment are:
- [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count), for a nicer word count.
- [Outliner](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner), for an outline of my documents.
- [Pandoc Reference List](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list), for an easy list of references.
- [PDF+](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus), exporting PDFs is the name, exporing PDFs is the game.
- [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration), does what is says on the tin.

These plugins are mostly self-explanatory, except for the fact that Pandoc Reference List and the Zotero Plugin work together, so that I get references in my writing but also an easy way to review the references in any given document. It also helps with the export to PDF functionality in PDF+.

## Tools for Practice
I make use of some key tools for my practice, which will continue into this research. They include:
- My trusty MacBook Pro;
- [Stamp](https://stamp.xyz), a video notation tool, helping me to take notes on my own work;
- A cheap webcam, because I don't need massive files (currently I'm using the Logitech C920 HD Pro from 2017!);
- And of course, a pencil and a script. Some things are easier on paper.

I am thinking about upgrading my webcam, not only because it is old, but also to spend less time trying to get the exposure right. Plus the Logitech C920 was never great at low light...

## Tools for the Website
This website is built using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), a free hosting service. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) & [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), a fork of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).
I edit the files for the site using [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), which as promised, doesn't suck.
These tools make the site lightweight and easy to maintain. Crucially, they also make sure that it is almost free to run.
To get my own domain, I already pay for [anthonyarblaster.com](https://anthonyarblaster.com) so adding a sub-domain with [Hover](https://hover.com), was really easy.

I don't currently test the site locally. 
I've tried setting it up using Homebrew but I haven't quite got it sussed yet. 
As the site is now up and running through trial and error, I will probably not bother.
I can add content fairly easily so I'm not too worried at the moment.
