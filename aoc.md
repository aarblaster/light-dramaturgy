# Acknowledgement of Country

I come from Canberra, Australia. I have lived, worked, and had holidays there. I am a product of that place and of the colonisation of land that did not belong to my ancestors.


I acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of that land, the Ngunnawal people, as well as the Ngambri, Ngarigu and others who traded on, travelled through and connected with it, and continue to do so. 
I recognise all Custodians of Country throughout all lands, waters and territories of the place now called Australia. 


I pay my respects to the Elders past, present and emerging.
