Hi, my name is Anthony. I'm a lighting designer for live performance based in London. 
I am originally from [Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, Australia](/about/aoc). 

## About Anthony
I started this PhD in 2025, while continuing teaching at the [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art](https://rada.ac.uk), in London. I teach lighting design, production electrics and programming on the Academy's practice-based courses. 
After completing a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws at the [Australian National University](https://anu.edu.au), I moved to London. In 2012 I completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Stage Electrics and Lighting Design at RADA. 


I live and work in London as an educator and Lighting Designer. You can find out more about me and my Lighting Design work, at [anthonyarblaster.com.](https://anthonyarblaster.com)

## About the PhD
The preliminary title is: **Towards a Light Dramaturgy: Techniques and Practice of Dramaturgy as Lighting Design**

This PhD is by creative practice through the School of Arts and Creative Technologies at the University of York.
It is supervised by [Dr Katherine Graham](https://www.york.ac.uk/arts-creative-technologies/people/katherine/) and [Dr Rebecca Benzie](https://www.york.ac.uk/arts-creative-technologies/people/rebecca-benzie/), both at the School of ACT. 

The PhD focuses on developing a dramaturgical tool kit for lighting designers to use while creating work. 
It isn't focused on the final product â€“ rather it aims to be a tool for practice. 

The PhD will be undertaken through practice-based research which will ensure that my arts practice sits inside and around the research.
