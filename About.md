Hi, my name is Anthony. I'm a lighting designer for live performance based in London. 
I am originally from Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, Australia. 

## About Anthony
I started this PhD in 2025, while continuing teaching at the [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art](https://rada.ac.uk), in London. I teach lighting design, production electrics and programming on the Academy's practice-based courses. 
After completing a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws at the [Australian National University](https://anu.edu.au), I moved to London. In 2012 I completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Stage Electrics and Lighting Design at RADA. 


I live and work in London as an educator and Lighting Designer. You can find out more about me and my Lighting Design work, at [anthonyarblaster.com.](https://anthonyarblaster.com)

## About the PhD
This PhD is by creative practice through the School of Arts and Creative Technologies at the University of York.
It is supervised by Dr Katherine Graham and Dr Rebecca Benzie. 
I am still finalising the title of the PhD.

The PhD focuses on developing a dramaturgical tool kit for lighting designers to use while creating work. 
It isn't focused on the final product â€“ rather it aims to be a tool for practice. 

The PhD will be undertaken through practice-based research which will ensure that my arts practice sits inside and around the research.
